# Aneurysm BrainCT scan Detection 
###**Project Purpose**:
This project, designed to create a neural network object detection model, holds great promise
in improving diagnostic accuracy. By predicting and generating diagnostic evaluations for
intracranial aneurysms, brain tumors, and brain cancer from brain CT scans, this model can
help clinicians diagnose and evaluate critical brain conditions more accurately. The potential
to significantly improve diagnostic accuracy can lead to better patient outcomes and save
lives, making this model a game-changer in the field.

#**Data set**:**Computed Tomography (CT) of the Brain.**
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/trainingdatapro/computed-tomography-ct-of-the-brain/data
The dataset consists of CT brain scans with cancer, tumor, and aneurysm. Each scan represents a detailed image of a patient's brain taken using CT (Computed Tomography). The data are presented in 2 different formats: .jpg and .dcm.
the dataseet contains 3 types of CT scan of brain diseases,which each file contains:
1. cancer - (168)files
2. Tumor - (182)files
3. Aneurysm - (168)files

##**Business care**:
To Create a web application that allows **radiologists** to
upload CT scans of the brain and quickly receive diagnostic assessments for intracranial
aneurysms, brain tumors, and brain cancer. This tool, based on the developed model, can
significantly improve the accuracy and speed of diagnosis, making it a valuable asset for
radiologists in their everyday work.

##**Goal:**
The main aim of this project is to create a Convolutional Neural Network (**CNN**) model
trained on brain CT images. We focus on detecting **aneurysms**, **tumors**, and **cancers** to
help radiologists with their everyday diagnostic work.
